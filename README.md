## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I used this section to practice more with the new concepts I learnt. I used new css properties, some examples are hover, cursor, div just to name a few. I also learned out to work on a recreating a UI design.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I looking forward to working with css and html5, and picking up new languages to better enhance my web development process.
